Setting up a personal blog was quite **annoying** and difficult years ago,
especially for beginners.
So when I forked these blog templates on GitHub under the guide of
**AI** and tried to modify the source files to make it ***"personalized"***
in 2023, it was **completely a mess**.
I tried like 4 times, but it always failed at last.

But after 4 years, everything changed.
AI is more powerful and I gained a lot of experience in programming.
I also **finally** know how to use **git**.

So it's time to **BUILD MY OWN BLOG**!

I started to give a **super detailed** prompt to Claude
to build a very simple one.
Then I copied it and uploaded to GitHub to see what would happen.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't support fetching files
**even** from the repo **itself** and I didn't realize that.
The **worst** thing is that, I was using **nvim** to edit it.
So when I finally realized it, I have pushed a few **trash** commits.

So I switched to **WebStorm**, the **awesome JetBrains IDE**,
to continue development.
I changed some HTML/CSS code to have a more satisfying and cool look.
And it's finally time to **WRITE A REAL BLOG**!

And here it is :).
